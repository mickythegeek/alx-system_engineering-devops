# API Advanced

### Description
This project focuses on advanced concepts of working with APIs, including how to navigate documentation, handle pagination, parse JSON, make recursive API calls, and sort data.

### Learning Objectives

- **How to Read API Documentation to Find the Endpoints Youâ€™re Looking For**
  - Learn how to effectively navigate API documentation to identify and understand the endpoints necessary for your project.

- **How to Use an API with Pagination**
  - Understand how to handle APIs that return data in paginated responses and how to iterate over all available data.

- **How to Parse JSON Results from an API**
  - Gain proficiency in parsing JSON data structures received from API calls into usable formats within your application.

- **How to Make a Recursive API Call**
  - Learn techniques for making recursive API calls to handle situations where subsequent requests depend on the responses of previous ones.

- **How to Sort a Dictionary by Value**
  - Understand how to sort dictionary data structures by their values to organize and analyze API data more effectively.

### Usage
Follow the provided examples to understand each concept, and implement them in your projects to enhance your API interaction capabilities.

### Installation
Ensure you have the necessary programming environment set up, including Python and any required libraries for handling HTTP requests and JSON parsing.

### Examples
- Navigating API documentation.
